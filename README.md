# Text-based emotional analysis model
I have developed an emotional chatbot that will have a conversation with users by asking them five questions. Then the pre-trained transformer model will do an emotional analysis based on the users' answers and detect the users' final emotion with the confidence rate shown. The final emotion will be either one of the seven emotions listed (happy, anger, disgust, fear, neutral, sadness, and surprise).

To execute this code, place both chatbox.py and the associated static file into the same directory. Run chatbox.py, then access the website by navigating to the URL http://127.0.0.1:5000 displayed in the terminal.
